# Data Analyst Learning Projects

This repository documents my journey to becoming a skilled data analyst. It contains practical mini-projects and concept-based exercises focused on:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Power BI dashboard building
- DAX vs Power Query logic
- SQL querying and aggregations
- Visualization best practices

Each folder contains a small project or hands-on task, including the dataset, formulas used, visuals, and key learnings.

This repo is meant to show progress, not perfection â€” from foundational topics to more advanced scenarios.
