# 📊 iPhone 14 vs iPhone 15 Sales Comparison (Power BI Project)

This project is a Power BI-based sales comparison dashboard between iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. The objective was to analyze, compare, and report sales performance across different countries using calculated metrics and visuals.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Conduct a **comparison analysis** of iPhone 15 sales and iPhone 14 sales using three datasets:

- `fact_sales_Iphone14.csv`
- `fact_sales_Iphone15.csv`
- `dim_stores.csv`

---

## 📌 Tasks Performed

1. **Reviewed and cleaned datasets**
   - Merged iPhone 14 & 15 sales data using `store_id` and `month`
   - Joined with `dim_stores` to bring in `country_name`

2. **Calculated metrics**
   - iPhone 14 total sales
   - iPhone 15 total sales
   - 🔸 **Absolute Variance** = `ABS([iPhone15 Sales] - [iPhone14 Sales])`
   - 🔸 **% Variance** = `([iPhone15 Sales] - [iPhone14 Sales]) / [iPhone14 Sales] * 100`

3. **Created DAX Measures**
   - Used `SUM`, `ABS`, and `DIVIDE` to build dynamic calculations grouped by country
   - Demonstrated difference between **Power Query row-level logic** and **DAX context-based aggregation**

4. **Built final dashboard**
   - Table view with: Country, iPhone14 Sales, iPhone15 Sales, Absolute Variance, % Variance
   - Bar chart of top 10 countries by sales variance
   - KPI cards showing absolute variance and % variance between sales.
